## PyData London Beginners Bootcamp

Here you can find the 4 notebooks, as well as some pre-processing scripts and the datasets needed.

There are html versions of the notebooks with output, and .ipynb versions without output.

All the notebooks are intended to be used with python3.5.

You may need to `pip install --user -r requirements.txt` or conda install the relevant packages.

The files are also hosted [here](https://conrad.pythonanywhere.com/pydata) and there is a tar file as well.
