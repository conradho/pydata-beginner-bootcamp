    "Today, we will take a quick look at how sizing works. There are certain theoretical sizing strategies that can be very useful as references. Let's take a look at the sensibility of using these in practice, and see how sizing usually works. We will start at the famous Kelly's Criterion and try to generalize it to be more applicable to our use case. In particular, let's try to generalize to find optimal sizing when losses can be partial (not total) and there may be multiple outcomes. This general solution may be messy to solve algebraically, but we can happily approximate it by running simulations (yay python!).\n",

    "- Let's try sampling from the binary outcomes and take what we see to approximate a $ \\mu $ and $ \\sigma $. Does the optimal sizing calculated by $ f = \\frac{\\mu - r}{ \\sigma ^ 2} $ differ from the correct optimal sizing? Now take the random variable wwith three possible discrete outcomes. How does the optimal sizing calculated by $ f = \\frac{\\mu - r}{ \\sigma ^ 2} $ differ with what we have found by running simulations?\n",
    "- In the `generate_optimal_sizing_chart` function, we see long term EV vs Sizing. Add an extra feature to generate Sharpe ratio vs Sizing and overlay it on the chart. Also overlay the expected P&L of a single trade on the same chart and compare what the differences are!\n",

    "- [fecon235](https://github.com/rsvp/fecon235) seems like a pretty cool library with lots of different ideas you would look at. Try your hand at understanding what they do, implement some strategies from there, and then\n",

    "Some more thoughts about sizing. If you are interested in learning more about sizing, here are a few resources:\n",
    "- While Turtle Traders are not quantitative traders, their thought process about \"units of risk\" is very enlightening and will help you develop an intuitive understanding for how this works\n",
    "- Euan Sinclair's Volatility Trading also goes into great detail about how to think about volatility and possibly the definitive book I've read on measuring volatility\n",

    "If you have an investment strategy with esoteric trades which do not have a typical log-normal return profile (eg: if you were a market maker, or if you were a merger arb fund), you could take a look at your past trades to (a) evaluate how accurate you were at estimating ev/risk- and hence understand how far smaller than optimal you can consider sizing, and (b) if you are putting on a similar trade, you can use the ev/risk profile of those past trades to directly estimate sizing, so you don't need to estimate it again!\n",
    "\n",
    "We have not looked at sizing considerations on a portfolio level (ie. how trades interact with each other) in this notebook. For that, check out [MPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory) and [Black-Litterman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Litterman_model). If you are in a pinch (or if you want to simplify things, or if you want to stress test your portfolio), you can also consider sizing your portfolio risk level with Kelly Criterion calculations discussed here and assuming all risk assets have correlation gone to 1."
