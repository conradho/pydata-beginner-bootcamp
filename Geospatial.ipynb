Take a look at the different algorithms for the [shortest path problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortest_path_problem), and the [travelling salesman problem](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem).\n",

Look into calculating the distance based on a globe-shaped geometry. It could be pretty easy to use a different distance function, but then you wouldn't be able to use the KDTrees. If you wanted to keep using that, you want to turn all coordinates to a vector to represent where they are located in space. Then the standard cartesian distance function would still work and so you can keep using KDTrees. One library for this is [proj4](https://github.com/jswhit/pyproj). Or for this usecase, you could just write a quick function to set that up yourself as well.\n",
